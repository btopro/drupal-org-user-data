drupal-org-user-data
====================

Harvest relevent data from a drupal.org user profile by spidering the html and abstracting

This is a module that allows you to harvest data from drupal.org associated with your user account.
This was written to supply data points about the impact of elms/ln by way of showcasing usage statistics
of projects created as a result of the project as well as commits, downloads, and time data.

If d.o. changes its html well then this will obviously break :p
